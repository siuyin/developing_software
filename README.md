# Developing Software

Refactor, Test and Document with Go.

This project aims to teach software developers good
software engineering practices.

It starts by defining requirements.

See the presentation: developing_software.slide

This requires the Go `present` tool to present.

Eg.

```
go present -http 3999 -orighost 127.0.0.1
```

The code walk-through is in `developing_software.article`.
